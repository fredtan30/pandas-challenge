# pandas-challenge


Heroes of Pymoli


Our main task is to analyzing the purchase data of every player based on item demographics, gender demographics and age demographics

This homework is basically a repetitive exercise where we learn how to use groupby function in pandas to calculate average, total and count in pandas and learn how to combined all these datas into the dataframe. On this homework we also know how to format and sorting the data, however I struggle and don't know how to sort value properly on the age_demographic in Pymoli Heroes data
